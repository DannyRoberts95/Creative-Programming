# Generative Design & Creative Coding

This respository is a collection of exercises that explore the area creative programming. The exercises are organised into "Color", "Shape" and "Type" each section containing a list of exercises exploring that area. This exploration resulted in the creation of two design projects, "Typographic Links" and "Bearings". Both of these projects can be viewed below.
