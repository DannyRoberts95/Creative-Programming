# Section 1 - Color and Color Theory

This repository is a collection of P5 sketches exploring the area of color and color theory. Each sketch can be viewed by clicking the link below the title.

This section will touch on:

- color generation
- interpolation
- palette generation from rule and images
- fragmentation
- randomness
- gradients
