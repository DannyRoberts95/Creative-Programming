# Section 2 - Shape

This repository is a collection of P5 sketches exploring the areas of shape and pattern. Each sketch can be viewed by clicking the link below the title.

This section will touch on:

- polar co-ordinates
- beginShape & endShape functions
- vertices
- grid systems & distortion of grid systems
- rotation of a system elements
- mouse interaction
